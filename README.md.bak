# Be_Amortisseur

This project aims to develop a suspension control system for a car. The control system should be able to keep the car stable on the road, even in difficult conditions.

The control system will be based on state feedback control. The inputs to the control system will be the wheel positions and the outputs will be the suspension forces. The control system will calculate the suspension forces necessary to keep the car stable.

The control system will be developed using the MATLAB software. The control system will be tested on a car simulator.

## Expected Results

The expected results of the project are the following:

* A suspension control system capable of keeping the car stable on the road, even in difficult conditions.
* An efficient and energy-saving control system.
* A control system that is easy to implement in a real car.

## Project Steps

The project steps are the following:

1. Model the suspension system.
2. Design the control system.
3. Implement the control system.
4. Test the control system.
